# 6111project

This branch (extrinsic_params) uses Leilani's restructuring of the camera code to use for displaying two cameras. In addition, this branch can send snapshots from both cameras through serial to a laptop, which then runs a Python script to save the incoming pixels into a png file. In addition, we have started a distance calculation module which takes the result from the object detection pipeline and calculates the coordinate of the object.
